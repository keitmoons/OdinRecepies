# OdinRecepies
This is the first website I'll build as a project for The Odin Project Course.
It's basically a simple website with some of my favourite recepies in which I'll use my groundings in HTML (just how to outline the basic structure and the characters, and links and images as well).
I'm glad I'm learning how to code, since I have no background in this field. This is a new adventure for me, I hope I'll get better in the future.
